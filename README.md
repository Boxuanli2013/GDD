Growing degree days (GDD), also called growing degree units (GDUs), are a heuristic tool in phenology. GDD are a measure of heat accumulation used by horticulturists, gardeners, and farmers to predict plant and animal development rates such as the date that a flower will bloom, or a crop will reach maturity.

In this project we going to do an extended work on the GDD on three different city.
The workflow for the project is as follow:
1. Automation for downloading tempreture data
2. Extracting required columns from data files
3. Calculating GDD (via command line program)
4. Storing calculations in DB or files
5. Creating plot showing an annual cycle of min/max daily temperatures.
6. Producing reports based on the generated plots.
