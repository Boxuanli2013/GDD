# GROWING DEGREE DAYS

## Introduction:
This is a project as part of our coursework for the term.

From Wikipedia:

Growing degree days (GDD), also called growing degree units (GDUs), are a heuristic tool in phenology. 
GDD are a measure of heat accumulation used by horticulturists, gardeners, and farmers to predict plant and animal development rates such as the date that a flower will bloom, or a crop will reach maturity.


GDD are calculated by taking the average of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures compared to a base temperature, Tbase, (usually 10 Â°C). As an equation:

	GDD = [(Tmax + Tmin)/2 - Tbase]
